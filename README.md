# Food-ordering-website

This project has two interfaces, one for costumer use and one for management.
Costumers can only place commands, without an account.
Managers do have sepparate accounts, but work on the same webpage. They can see the orders made and upgrade them as they seee fit. They can also modify the products shown on the costumer interface.
